        <p>Dr. Richard O. Ocaya is a National Research Foundation (NRF)-rated researcher who is active in computing, mathematical methods, new techniques for device characterization, material science and microcontroller-based instrument design. He is currently teaching in the University of the Free State, South Africa, in the Department of Physics. He actively collaborates with like-researchers in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Japan, Egypt, South Korea, US.</p>
            
            <p>He specializes in electronics, solid-state physics and computational physics.</p>

        <p>Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter. This distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering as it uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification rather than just using passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance. 

        I teach the following modules in the department.
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#phys2624">PHYS2624</a>. This is an undergraduate module in which we introduce the basic concepts of electronics without relying too heavily on prior knowledge.</li>
            <li><a href="#phye6844">PHYE6844</a>. In this postgraduate module, we build upon the knowledge learned in the undergraduate module and delved deeper into systems design. Our emphasis in this module is on developing instruments for scientific research. The overarching goal of this module is to produce graduates who can build high accuracy albeit low-cost instruments that are directly applicable locally. </li>
