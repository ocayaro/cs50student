        Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter. This distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering as it uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification rather than just using passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance. 
        <ol>
            <li>In <a href="#phys2624">PHYS2624</a> which is an undergraduate module, we introduce the basic concepts of electronics without relying too heavily on prior knowledge.</li>
            <li>In <a href="#phye6844">PHYE6844</a>, a postgraduate module, we build on the knowledge learned in the undergraduate module and delved deeper into systems design. Our emphasis is on developing instruments for scientific research.</li>
