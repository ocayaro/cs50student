        <p>Electronics comprises the physics, engineering, technology and applications that deal with the emission, flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter. This distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering as it uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification rather than just using passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance. 

        I teach the following modules in the department.
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#phys2624">PHYS2624</a>. This is an undergraduate module in which we introduce the basic concepts of electronics without relying too heavily on prior knowledge.</li>
            <li><a href="#phye6844">PHYE6844</a>. In this postgraduate module, we build upon the knowledge learned in the undergraduate module and delved deeper into systems design. Our emphasis in this module is on developing instruments for scientific research. The overarching goal of this module is to produce graduates who can build high accuracy albeit low-cost instruments that are directly applicable locally. </li>
