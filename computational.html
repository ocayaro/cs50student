            Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science.</p>

            <p>Solid materials are formed from densely packed atoms, which interact intensely. These interactions produce the mechanical (e.g. hardness and elasticity), thermal, electrical, magnetic and optical properties of solids. Depending on the material involved and the conditions in which it was formed, the atoms may be arranged in a regular, geometric pattern (crystalline solids, which include metals and ordinary water ice) or irregularly (an amorphous solid such as common window glass).</p>

            Computational physics in the department comes as the honors module:
      <ol>
          <li><a href="#phyi6864">PHYI6864</a>. Our emphasis in this module is modeling and simulating macro-materials as perturbed multi-body problems. We start at the pairwise potential and then introduce defects in the form of additive or missing atoms, forces applied within the low-extension regions of Hooke's Law, and so on. Using this approach, we have extensively studied the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure for atoms such as Cu, Pt, Au and others. We proposed a methodology to model the behavior of phonons in FCC crystals. Our published simulation results have been very promising, and could lead to the improvement of heat removal in nanostructured interconnects in low-nm computer processors. </li>
