        <h5>The purpose of this site</h5>
            This site started out as part of Harvard University's wonderful <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/course/">Python and Javascript programming course</a> that I enrolled into during the global coronavirus-driven (or COVID-19) pandemic. What better way to occupy the expansive national lockdown? 
            
            <p>Having overcome the initial fumbling that produced a mediocre and rather pointless site, it occurred to me that the site could actually mirror what I do in real-life, to be a fully functional and pragmatic site that students especially can use.</p>
