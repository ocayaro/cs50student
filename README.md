About this site
---------------

This document is submitted by Dr. Richard O. Ocaya as his rendition of Project 0 for Harvard University's CS50 Python and Javascript programming (EDX50) course. We are currently in the ravages of global COVID-19 pandemic, and I decided to make a better use of the time. 

Site contents
-------------

There are four interconnected .html pages (index, electronics, solidstate and computational) that implement the following:

- two stylesheets - one for Bootstrap 4 and one for my variables (variables.css) 
- Bootstrap's grid model with three columns {200px auto auto} 
- more than five CSS properties and demonstrate SCSS inheritance
- the #id selector at least once 
- ordered and unordered lists
- one table
- images on every page
- the .class selector is used several times, including with inheritance
- a mobile-responsive @media query is also implemented for smaller (mobile) displays

Other achievements
------------------
- Commenting in html (<!>) and in SCSS (/* */) for blocks and inline (//). The SCSS file is heavily commented as a guide and for future reference
- Use of forms for feedback on the website 

I hope that you will like the site.
