There are four interconnected .html pages (index, electronics, solidstate and computational) that implement the following:

- two stylesheets - one for Bootstrap 4 and one for my variables (variables.css) 
- Bootstrap's grid model with three columns {200px auto auto} 
- more than five CSS properties and demonstrate SCSS inheritance
- the #id selector at least once 
- ordered and unordered lists
- one table
- images on every page
- the .class selector is used several times, including with inheritance
- a mobile-responsive @media query is also implemented for smaller (mobile) displays
